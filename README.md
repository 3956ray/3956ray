## ðŸ‘‹Hi there, I'm Ray
I am from Taiwan and currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Technology at South China University of Technology in Guangzhou. My academic and project experience focuses on blockchain technology, decentralized applications, and software engineering. I am proficient in Python, Golang, and Solidity, with hands-on experience in smart contract development, testing, and deployment.

Recently, I have been actively participating in hackathons. These experiences allow me to collaborate with diverse teams, exchange ideas deeply, and broaden my perspective while sharpening my technical and problem-solving skills.

## ðŸ”­ Current Project
Iâ€™m currently working on [FrisbeDAO](https://github.com/3956ray/FrisbeeDAO). A blockchain-based decentralized athlete token trading platform, focused on the issuance and trading of personal tokens for frisbee athletes.
